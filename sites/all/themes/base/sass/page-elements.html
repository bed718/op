		<h2>About O+P</h2>
		<p>Opened in January 2015, Odys + Penelope is a casual, churrasco and grill by Quinn and Karen Hatfield, the culinary power couple behind the popular neighborhood eatery, The Sycamore Kitchen. At the heart of Odys + Penelope are its open grill, wood-fired smoker and Brazilian churrasco. Using these elemental live-fire cooking methods, <img src="/sites/all/themes/base/images/other/O+P-bar-1.jpg" alt="O+P Bar" class="image-left"> the restaurant offers an eclectic menu of flavorful and simply prepared California fare, with a strong emphasis on locally sourced and sustainable meats, seafood and seasonal vegetables.</p>

		<h3>The Food</h3>
		<p>Starters and small bites include The Farmer’s Dozen Salad with 12 seasonal raw and roasted veggies, herbs, pepita “butter” and lime vinaigrette and Hot Skillet Focaccia served with dandelion greens and parmesan. Moving toward entrées, hearty plates like Slow Grilled Wagyu Tri-tip with charred broccolini and O+P béarnaise appear alongside lighter offerings such as Grilled Line Caught Swordfish with barley, mushrooms, cherry balsamic and salsa verde. Seasonal sides run the gamut and include Creamy Cauliflower and Millet with walnut pesto and Panang Sautéed Blue Lake Beans with roasted peanuts. Also not to be missed are “The Specials from the Brasero,” a section of the menu offering simple preparations from the fire that are made for sharing such as the Dry-Rubbed Smoked Short Ribs with Quinn’s Western Sweet Sauce and Bacon Wrapped Chicken <img src="/sites/all/themes/base/images/other/O+P-food-1.jpg" alt="O+P Bar" class="image-right"> Thighs with lemon date sauce. Finishing the meal is a selection of Karen’s critically acclaimed desserts including Chocolate Pie with Spanish peanuts in a rye crust, served with malted ice cream. </p>
		
		<h3>The Drink</h3>
		<p>Odys + Penelope offers a full slate of craft beer and wine, as well as handcrafted cocktails such as the Bloody Derby made with blood orange juice, honey and rye whiskey.</p>

		<h3>The Style</h3>
		<p>Original Greek-style columns in the District La Brea space sparked the inspiration for the name, which pays tribute to the legendary couple, Odysseus and Penelope of Homer’s Greek epic, the Odyssey. The restaurant features a modern rustic design with a semi-open kitchen allowing guests a view the live-fire cooking elements at work.</p>
